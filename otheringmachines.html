  <p><b>introduction</b>
    <br> How come that in human societies, in a group of so, so many individuals, shared opinions or even collective minds form? Aren’t we, as an individually thinking entities, not autonomous enough to follow our private axioms and go our own ways? As
    inert beings, it is easier to follow ideologic trends, adopt to ideas of others or let the most charismatic characters color your view of the world. This way big groups easily split up into tribes. Not only that our slackness alone makes it hard enough
    to make the effort to listen to everyone’s opinions, but more than that, interhuman communication is burdened with perpetual misunderstandings. Sometimes we simply misunderstand each other acoustically, sometimes we just don’t want to understand,
    and sometimes we cannot understand another point of view than ours, because we base most of what we think to know on what we’ve heard so far. And that is, only if we heard it from the right people, our closest ones or other input sources we find trustworthy.
    Thus, we group up to build surroundings of comfort and slackness.

  <p><b>method</b>
    <br>An experiment will be carried out, with several devices communicating via sound emission and reception. Each object writes own reference database of sounds it has heard before, and, based on that, decide whether it accepts other devices’ arguments
    or not. The following simple simulation represents a setup of multiple devices that communicate by integer transmission (that are written into the objects’ independent databases).

  <p><b>Fig. 1</b>
    <br> This example shows how groups start to form when individual objects move towards (if in favor of) or away from (if disagreeing with) a data sending source. This gives a first hint for the dynamics of primitive tribe-formation within societies.

  <p><b>next steps</b>

    <br><br>* implementation of data loss upon travel distance
    <br>* try it with hardware! (2-prototypes-communication experiments)
